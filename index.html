    Ethan John Souleles
  </h1>

  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>My name is Ethan John Souleles, and I am from Fawkner, Victoria, Australia. I am half Greek, a quarter Maltese, and a quarter Australian. 
  I am currently studying my first semester of BP162 Bachelor of Information Technology after transferring from BP096 Bachelor of Software Engineering. 
  I decided to transfer into this course this semester because I want to get a better understanding of all different aspects of IT instead of primarily focussing on programming and software development, making this program the obvious decision for me. 
  Prior to university, I attended John Fawkner Secondary College undertaking VCE.</p>
  
  <p>My biggest hobby is gym, more specifically strength training. I could spend hours talking about different training techniques and nutrition. 
  A secondary hobby of mine is playing video games. I am a FPS gamer, my favourite games being CSGO and COD. I own two cats and a dog.</p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <p>My interest in IT started when I was in Year 6 where my primary school, St Matthews Primary School, had a computer room that would be opened during lunchtimes on Friday. 
  I would always go in with my friends and tinker around, mostly by finding ways to bypass the internet restrictions and play video games. 
  In High School, it was the same ordeal. As soon as I got my laptop for school, I found a way to bypass the internet proxy and bypass all the administrative restrictions. 
  I eventually got my own PC, and I was obsessed. I would spend countless hours playing video games and finding different tweaks and optimizations I can do to my system to make it run more efficiently. 
  I would quite often fix various hardware and software problems for my friends and sometimes teachers, to the point where I became the kid that was “good with computers”, which in my opinion was a very far stretch.</p>

  <p>Now that I am older and my interest for playing video games has basically faded, my interest in IT has been more focussed on Networking / Cyber Security. 
  I was primarily inspired by my family friend who is currently studying Bachelor of Cyber Security at a different university, he showed me some of the aspects of Cyber Security and it sparked my interest. 
  I was also inspired to get into IT in general by my godfather who is the CEO of the IT firm Asta Solutions. 
  I worked for him for almost 3 months in total doing technical support / triage and learning software development. 
  While I was working there, I spoke to a bunch of different people who specialise in various fields of IT, and Networking intrigued me the most.</p>

  <p>I chose to come to RMIT because of its status of being one of the best universities in Victoria for Engineering and Technology, both statistically and anecdotally. 
  In conjunction, the location of the campus is very easy for me to access with public transport and takes me less than an hour to get from my house to campus, which makes it super convenient. 
  Additionally, I also had a lot of acquaintances from High School show interest in RMIT.</p>

  <p>During my studies, I expect to learn about various aspects of Information Technology. 
  I expect to learn about Programming, Data Science, Networking, Project Management, Security, and Artificial Intelligence to name a few. 
  By having knowledge on many different aspects of IT, I would be able to make an informed decision about my future career path based on what I enjoy doing the most but also what the prospects of that area of IT are.</p>
  
  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53398517">Original Source</a></p>
  <p><a href="https://gyazo.com/05162ae82005b71ec87bc327f3294de7">Snapshot of Job Listing</a></p>
  <p>My ideal job is to be working as a Network Engineer. From my basic and limited understanding of the role, a Network Engineer is someone who installs, develops, and manages computer networks and systems. They also must troubleshoot any problems that come up and ensure that all systems are secure and running optimally. This position is appealing for me because it requires a wide range of different skills, and it compensates very well for the job’s responsibilities. In addition, it also has aspects of Cyber Security and Network Programming, which is something I could potentially be interested in.</p>
  <p>This job listing requires that I have a bachelor’s degree in ICT or Network Engineering, 3 years of relevant work experience, experience and knowledge with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) networks and Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. It also expects that I have excellent problem-solving skills, ability to work as a team in a dynamic environment, and the ability to meet the expectations of stakeholders.</p>
  <p>Currently, I have none of the requirements that the job listing is asking for, but that’s to be expected as I am fresh out of High School and in my first year of tertiary education. You could technically argue that I have 3 months of work experience, but as this isn’t related to Networking, I wouldn’t count it as relevant. I plan to obtain the skills required for the position by completing my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University, completing subjects that are relevant to Networking, and obtain work experience at Asta Solutions once I have finished my degree. In addition, I also plan to obtain the following certifications that other employers may potentially require whilst I’m studying:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CompTIA A+</li>
    <li>CompTIA Networking+</li>
    <li>CompTIA Security+</li>
    <li>Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Obviously, I am taking the results of these online tests with a grain of salt as it is unlikely that one online test with a handful of questions can determine with perfect accuracy the traits of a person in terms of learning style and personality. However, I will take these results into account when I am in a group environment. The results of these tests show that I am a neutral and more observant individual that tends to keep thoughts, ideas, and opinions to myself in order to avoid conflict and disagreement with my peers. In terms of the learning style test, it seems that I learn with a combination of the three styles, which makes sense to me because different skills require different learning styles to know. For example, coding is best learnt with a combination of Auditory (reading and learning the basic concepts) and Tactile (applying them in a coding environment) whereas learning a new gym exercise is best learnt Visually.</p>
  <p>A point that does come up on both the 16personalities Test and the Big Five Personality Test that I do agree with is that I do have a tend to cooperate rather than compete with others and avoid conflicts. In a group setting, this would make me a sub-optimal leader as I am less able to “put my foot down” when it comes to decision making, I’d rather do as I am told to get the task done and move onto the next thing. It would be easier and more comfortable for me to be assigned a particular task(s) in a group project and just get them done rather than be the sense of direction for the group. Another point that comes up is that I tend to be more observant, but I keep to myself. This could be problematic in a group setting as I could find another solution to a problem or find another way to complete a task, but since I keep to myself and want to avoid conflict, I may not bring that solution to the group’s attention. That is something I need to work on to be a more productive member of a team.</p>

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    My project idea is a mobile application which I will call “JukeBox”. The application will essentially a combination of the music application Spotify and popular dating platform Tinder. The application presents the user with new songs they haven’t heard before based on their favourite genres and artists, which they are able to either swipe right to show they “like” the song, which automatically saves the name of the song and adds it to a pre-determined playlist, or they can swipe left to “dislike” the song. After every swipe, a new song will appear on-screen for the user to listen to until the application is closed.
  </p>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>My reasoning for wanting to make this application is that I, as with most people, find it difficult to find new music / new artists to listen to. Majority of the music I listen to comes from already popular artists or are recommended to me by peers. I am not alone, it is estimated that over 50% of people listen to some form of music daily, most of which potentially run into the same issue where they’re just listening to the same music for hours on end, with no good way to find new music. An application where the user can find new music with just a few swipes either left or right would be super convenient and time efficient.</p>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>The user would download the application just like any other application, which would be through either the Google PlayStore or the App Store. The user will then be asked to create an account so the song recommendations can be saved for that specific user. During the account creation process, the user will be asked a series of questions based around their music tastes and what artists they already currently listen to. Once set up, the application will give the user an option whenever or not they need a video tutorial on how to use the application. If declined, the user can get straight to using the app. If accepted, an embedded pre-recorded short video will play giving the user a basic outline on how to use the application. The user will also be given the option to upload a photo for their account profile.</p>
  <p>Once set up, the app will start displaying music on-screen. It will show the album cover of the song and a playback bar. The user will be able to play, pause, rewind, and fast forward the song that is currently being displayed. Once the user feels they have decided on whenever or not they like the song, they can either swipe right to add the song to a “liked music” list or they can swipe left to dislike the song and move onto the next song. No matter if the user swipes left or right, there will be another new song for the user to listen to.</p>
  <p>As stated, all songs that the user swipes right on is added to a “liked music” list, which the user can access at anytime whilst the application is open. The user would be able to re-listen to songs on their liked playlist and remove songs at any time. The user can also share songs on their liked music via a share button, which would give them the option to either share via text message, email, or copy the URL to send on any other messaging platform they wish.</p>
  <p>Another feature of the application is to be able to search for profiles of other users of the application. The user will be able to type a username into a search bar and, if the username is typed correctly, will direct the user to the profile which they search for. On the profile page, it will display the profile photo and the music which that user liked. However, to ensure that the user has the right to privacy, there will be an option to be able to hide liked music on their public profile so other users cannot see it.</p>
  <p>At any time, the user can access a settings menu and change their genre and artist preferences. This feature is implemented because the music tastes of people can drastically change overtime, and it is important to ensure that the application can help meet the new demands of the end user. In addition, to comply with the laws and regulations, there will be an option to delete the account of the user and an option to download all the data that the application collects on behalf of the user.</p>
  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
  <p>Since this is a software application, the only physical hardware needed is a mobile device (preferably android) and a computer to write the programming on. The mobile device will be used to test the usability of the application as well as ensure that GUI is user-friendly and is being displayed properly. In terms of software, this will primarily be a web-based application. This means it will need HTML, CSS, and Java. It will also need a backend to be able to store the information, which means it will need a database manager like SQL. The information that will be stored is the login details of the users and their liked music. </p>
  <h3>Skills Required</h3>
  <p>The skills that will be required for my project idea will be Java Programming, Database Programming, HTML5 / CSS Web Programming, and API. A lot of skills required can be learned (relatively) easily through the internet. However, using an API might be challenging but, by using Youtube’s API, there should be plenty of documentation and video tutorials. </p>
  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be that people who consume music will be able to more easily find new songs and artists based on music they already like. This will help eliminate the frustration that comes with trying to find new music to listen to. Indirectly, this will help up and coming musical talent be able to reach a broader audience and help them gain more fans and listeners, increasing their popularity. </p>
